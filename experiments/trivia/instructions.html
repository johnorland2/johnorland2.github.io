                    Overview:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Primarily, the application presents a sequence of interactive
                    multiple choice questions.  This interface could be used as part of a "trivia" game
                    at a party.  Alternatively, the interface could be adapted for use as a study/memory aid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user may use mouse clicks to interact with the page.  Clicks are used
                    to transition between application phases, and to submit answers to questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    About how to click on stuff properly:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look out for orange rectangles that show a pointer (hand)
                    icon when the mouse is moved into hovering viscinity.  These
                    rectangles may be construed as buttons; a click triggers a
                    transition in the application.  The rectangle's textual label
                    is a cue that suggests the behavior that's connected with a click.
                    You might see other textual indications in the viscinity of these
                    rectangles, and these indications further elucidate what's going on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Description of phases:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. The first type of phase is the "menu".  In this phase, the user can see a "title"
                    and a button that says, "play".  Clicking the button transitions the application
                    to a question phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. The second type of phase is the "question" phase.  The user can see a textual
                    indication of the question's prompt and the question's category.  Below these indications,
                    there are multiple clickable buttons.  Each button represents a possible answer to the
                    question; the button's textual label conveys a possible answer to the question.
                    You get one chance to answer a question.  If you click on one answer, then your
                    opportunity is spent. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After clicking an answer, the application is transitioned to a subphase that shows
                    a textual indication that the answer was either correct or incorrect.  This 
                    subphase also gives a button; the button either leads to another question phase, or
                    leads to the summary phase if no further questions are available.  Look for a textual cue that
                    elucidates what's going on at this point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. The third (final) type of phase is the summary.  In this phase, you can see a textual indication that
                    explains how many questions were answered correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note about questions and subject matters:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The questions and answers were designed by the developer (John).  They are inspired/motivated by
                    hobby reading, recent events and similar things.  These subjects are not the main focus on this
                    technical demonstration.  Further, the questions and answers might somehow misportray the
                    subjects; this project is not an authoritative source of truth regarding the topics.  The questions
                    and answer options involve the developer's opinion, and there might be some surprise/discordance with
                    what's expected/imagined by the end user.  The user
                    should take caution when deciding whether to try the questions.  The user may take interest in the 
                    topics and perform subsequent research as desired.  The questions/answers are not meant to majorly influence
                    the end user beyond the scope of brief interaction with this page; if influence is taken, it ought to be like 
                    "the application has reminded me about X subject, and I may find/verify information by consulting reference material" rather than "the application informs me to believe some information
                    about subject X."  Accordingly, a highly-detailed bibliography is not included.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The categories in this demonstration are: "anthropological", "computer programming", "driver's safety",
                    "physical fitness" and "outdoors recreation".
                </p>
                <p>
                    A future version of the application could be reworked/adapted to have other categories, different
                    types of questions and other modifications/enhancements.

                <p>
                    This application is an academic project.  The application
                    might have defects.  Optionally avoid complications via the following strategies:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Avoid further using the application via closing the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Avoid copying and reusing the code in precarious ways.  Get help from an expert.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Apply common sense!  Identify and apply other strategies for avoiding complications.

                    Elaboration:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although hands-on learning and developing/sharing of projects by students might be somewhat typical and encouraged,
                    distributing code to end users has various inherent risks.  For example, the code
                    might exhibit behaviors and side-effects on an end user's machine, whereas these things
                    were not observed during research/development on the developer's equipment.  In some circumstances,
                    the behaviors and side-effects might cause issues, including, but not limited to, the following:
                    a. loss of data, b. damage to equipment, c. miscommunications/misunderstandings, d. unintended expenditures/losses of money.
                    Apparently, control of risks involves various things, including, but not limited to, the following: 
                    a. limitations of liability provisos in consumers' equipment/software licenses...
                    b. laws in various jurisdictions
                    c. etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apparently, these things combine to form a spectrum/mesh of contexts and protections. This permits
                    development to continue despite inherent risks.  Ideally end users would not experience major issues and losses due to forewarning; ideally they would be able to opt out
                    and/or implement their own client-side protections before reaching a point of assuming major risks.
                </p>

                    In the future, this application might be redesigned or repurposed in order to increase safety
                    and compliance with norms, recommendations, etc..  In the meantime, it is cautiously
                    presented in order to promote shared awareness of the research subject, mutual intellectual flourishment, etc..
